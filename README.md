# Random-Forest-from-Scratch
This repository contains Python code for building a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. 
The Random Forest algorithm is implemented from scratch using NumPy and scikit-learn.
# Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a known dataset in machine-learning. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and fare, and the target variable indicating whether a passenger survived the disaster, or not.
